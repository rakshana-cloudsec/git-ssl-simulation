# Git + SSL + Domain Error Simulation

This project simulates a common issue developers face when Git is used with custom domains and SSL certificates. The goal is to demonstrate how to reproduce and resolve Git + domain + SSL-related errors in a safe environment.

## ðŸ§ª Scenario
- Git over HTTPS to a domain with invalid or untrusted SSL certificate.
- Typical errors include `SSL certificate problem`, `unable to get local issuer certificate`, or `Could not resolve host`.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Git CLI
- Bash shell
- Simulated domain (non-existent)

## ðŸ§¯ What You'll See
- Simulated error output from a Git clone attempt
- Explanation and solution steps in `solution.md`
