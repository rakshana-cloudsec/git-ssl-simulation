# Git + SSL Error Simulation Project

This project simulates a common Git + SSL/domain misconfiguration scenario for debugging and learning purposes. It mimics the type of real-world issues often encountered when managing Git repositories hosted on custom domains or behind HTTPS.

## üîç Purpose

This repository was created as part of my freelance cybersecurity portfolio to demonstrate:

- Debugging Git over HTTPS issues
- Handling SSL certificate/domain misconfiguration
- Testing Git clone/push/pull scenarios from broken environments
- Providing clean solutions and documentation to clients

## üíª What's Inside

- `index.html`: Static placeholder site
- `script.sh`: Simulated shell script to reproduce a Git SSL issue
- `.gitconfig`: Mock Git configuration to simulate SSL error
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions

## üöÄ How to Run (for Testing)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourdomain.com/yourrepo.git
